Automatically detect and change the name of attachments containing special characters such as accented letters.

== Description ==

Accented file names can cause various problems when hosting or transferring a web site from a server to another.

This plugin automatically detects and changes the name of attachments containing special characters such as accented letters.

For example: if a user uploads a file named "L'École de Éric Rémillard.png", the file name will be transformed and the file will be stored as "L_Ecole_de_Eric_Remillard.png".

= Features =

* Detects accents in newly uploaded files' names, and change them for their unaccented version (ie. é -> e)
